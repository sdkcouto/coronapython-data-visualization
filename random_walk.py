#15-4. Modified Random Walks: In the class RandomWalk, x_step and y_step are generated from the same set of conditions. The direction is chosen randomly from the list [1, -1] and the distance from the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Modify the values in these lists to see what happens to the overall shape of your walks. Try a longer list of choices for the distance, such as 0 through 8, or remove the â€“1 from the x or y direction list.

#15-5. Refactoring: The method fill_walk() is lengthy. Create a new method called get_step() to determine the direction and distance for each step, and then calculate the step. You should end up with two calls to get_step() in fill_walk():

# x_step = get_step()
# y_step = get_step()

# This refactoring should reduce the size of fill_walk() and make the method easier to read and understand.
